  <p>Q1: Implemetn a Node class to represent and element in a linked list with properties value adn next</p>

  <p>Q2: Implement a Linkedlist class with methods to add a node to the end, remove a node from the end, and display all nodes</p>

  <p>Q3: Implement a Stack class with methods push (add element), pop (remove element), and peek (view the top element).</p>

  <p>Q4: Use the Stack class to reverse a string by pushign all characters onto the stack and then popping them off.</p>

  <p>Q5: Implement a Queue class with methods (add element), dequque(remove element), and front (View the first element)</p>

  <p>Q6: Use the Queue class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added to the queue and processed in order</p>

  <p>Q7: Implement a TreeNode clas to represent a node in a binary tree with properties value, left and right</p>

  <p>Q8: Implement a BinaryTree class with methods for inserting values adn performing in-order traversal to display nodes</p>

  <p>Q9: Implement a Graph class with methods to add vertices, and  edges, and perform a breadth-first search (BFS).</p>

  <p>Q10: Use the Graph class to represent  a simple network and perform BFS to fidn the shortest path between two nodes</p>
